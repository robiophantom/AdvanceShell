# mysh – AI-Enhanced Natural Language Shell

### mysh is a custom Python shell designed to behave like a lightweight version of Linux shells (fish, bash, zsh) — but with a powerful twist:

#### ✔ Supports traditional shell commands
#### ✔ Includes advanced built-ins (network tools, history, file operations)
#### ✔ Features automatic autosuggestions
#### ✔ Maintains persistent shell history
#### ✔ AND — integrates a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine using Groq LLM
